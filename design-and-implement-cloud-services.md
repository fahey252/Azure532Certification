## Design and Implement Cloud Services
  * The Cloud Services feature is part of the Microsoft Azure __Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) offering__.
  * Ability to deploy websites and asynchronous work to Azure servers with simpler deployment options and without the need to manage complex networking and operating system updates.
  * Provide configuration settings to determine the choice of __operating system family and version, networking topology, server allocation and instance count__, and more.
  * Azure takes the package configuration and files to deploy each project to virtual machines (VMs).
  * Develop, configure, deploy, and debug Cloud Services.
